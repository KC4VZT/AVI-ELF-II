# AVI ELF II
The AVI ELF II is a reproduction of the 1802-based computer kit by Netronics Research and Development Limited. 

The AVI ELF II computer was reimagined by the late Ed Keefe (1964-2022) to maintain the aesthetic of the original ELF II, with additional onboard RAM and daughter cards for flexibility of keypad encoders and display drivers.

This project is ongoing. Below you will find a stable version of the PCB gerber files, bill of materials. The Assembly Manual is in progress and will be uploaded in the very early part of 2024, if not sooner.

There are a number of differences between the AVI ELF II and the original:
